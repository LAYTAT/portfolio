I was responsible for implementing report management features within the in-house CRM system to ensure AWS solutions architects could accurately and promptly record their work with partners, including report hygiene checks and due notifications using AWS SNS.

          To optimize the system's performance, I decoupled and streamlined existing modules using various AWS services such as AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS CloudFront, and AWS SQS. This resulted in a reduction of operational overhead, improved system availability, and simplified the codebase.
          
          To enhance the system's data security, I integrated the current modules with AWS IAM, Cognito, and Secret Manager.
          
          In addition, I designed and implemented a recommendation feature that increased user input efficiency using AWS DynamoDB and AWS Polaris React framework. I utilized AWS CDK and CodePipeline for streamlined cloud resource provisioning.`,

Specifically, I engaged in the re-engineering of computation modules for optimized performance by utilizing GPUs with OpenCL and CUDA. This led to a remarkable enhancement of critical calculations such as IIR filter, resulting in a speed increase of over 100%. Moreover, I developed a metric system to analyze system performance. Additionally, I designed a real-time graphs rendering feature for clients to analyze real-time spectrum within the analysis system using OpenGL. I implemented dynamic scaling to ensure a stable refresh rate of 60 Hz for clients with different computing power levels. Finally, I directed the implementation of features that facilitated the system to run over Wi-Fi on drones with self-designed transfer protocols using UDP.

          Furthermore, I optimized the I/O multiplexing with epoll for featured server services, leading to a 10% increase in server CPU utilization efficiency.
          
          To ensure a seamless gaming experience, I designed and implemented a synchronization solution that compensated client applications with smooth strategies to stabilize game rendering, even with more than 150ms network latency.
